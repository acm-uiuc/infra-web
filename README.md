The Infra Committee is responsible for managing ACM @ UIUC's core software engineering and infrastructure efforts, both on-premises and in the cloud. We specialize in developing enterprise-level products that are robust, scalable, and user-friendly, designed to meet the needs of a diverse and growing community of 1000+ CS students at UIUC.

## Main Projects 

- **[ACM Core](https://github.com/acm-uiuc/core):** A comprehensive platform for:
  - Event management
  - Ticketing
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Membership servicing
  - Room reservations
  - SIG/Committee information
  - Link shortening (via [acm.gg](https://acm.gg/))
  - ...and more!
- **[Resume Book](https://resumes.acm.illinois.edu):** Bridging the gap between UIUC CS/ECE students and corporate recruiters.
- Other miscellaneous projects

We take pride in delivering high-quality, enterprise-level solutions that empower our members and enhance their experience while enabling SIG and committee chairs to do their work effectively.
